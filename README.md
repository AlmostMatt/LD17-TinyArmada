--HOW TO PLAY--
Left click to select a unit or building, or drag to select multiple units.
You can double click to select all units of a given type

If a building is selected, a menu appears for units it can produce.

Small ships can be ordered to trade with small cities, which will generate a profit when they return
Large ships can attack enemies and can gain control of other cities

Ships heal when near a friendly city.

If you destroy a capital, you gain control of it and any related ships.
